## Quick Notes: Privacy policy

Welcome to Quick Notes app for Android!

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.android.permission.INTERNET` | This is required to connect to the internet |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
